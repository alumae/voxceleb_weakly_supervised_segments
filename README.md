This repository contains speaker segmentations for the VoxCeleb1 dataset, generated using weakly supervised training, as described in the paper referenced below.

There are two segmentation files. [One](voxceleb1_sid_segments) contains the segmentations for training portion of the speaker identification task and the [other](voxceleb1_sv_segments) for the training portion of the speaker verification task.

For more information, see the paper [_Training Speaker Recognition Models with Recording-level Labels_](doc/alumae2018training.pdf), to appear in the proceedings of SLT 2018.
